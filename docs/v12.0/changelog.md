## Major changes for ThinkGeo 12.0

1. Merge all the managed layers to Core and used GDAL to redesign Unmanged Layers. Rename the packages name, here is latest package name;

* ThinkGeo.UI.Wpf

* ThinkGeo.UI.Blazor

* ThinkGeo.UI.WebApi

* ThinkGeo.Core
* ThinkGeo.Gdal
* ThinkGeo.Ecw 
* ThinkGeo.Cad
* ThinkGeo.GeoTiff
* ThinkGeo.Jpeg2000 
* ThinkGeo.MrSi  
* ThinkGeo.UmanagedProj 
* ThinkGeo.NuticalCharts  
* ThinkGeo.FileGeoDatabase  
* ThinkGeo.PersonalGeoDatabase  
* ThinkGeo.Oracle   
* ThinkGeo.Sqlite   
* ThinkGeo.MsSql   
* ThinkGeo.PostgreSql
* ThinkGeo.Printers  

* ThinkGeo.Dependency.SQLite
* ThinkGeo.Dependency.MicrosoftVisualCRunTime140 
* ThinkGeo.Dependency.NetTopologySuite
* ThinkGeo.Dependency.Npgsql 
* ThinkGeo.Dependency.Printers
* ThinkGeo.Dependency.SkiaSharp 
* ThinkGeo.Dependency.SqlClient
* ThinkGeo.Dependency.Jint
* ThinkGeo.Dependency.SQLite
* ThinkGeo.Dependency.WriteableBitmapEx

2. Redesign GeoCanvas based on SkiaSharp.

3. Updated all the C++ runtime to one single version, use MSVC140.

4. Use one GDAL C# wrap instead of raster layer wrappers, like JPEG2000, ECW, MrSid, Tiff, .etc.

5. Removed FDO, and SDF layer.

6. Renamed our all MapControl to MapView.

7. Used GDAL for S57 and FileGeoDatabase and PersonalGeoDatabase, this will inherit from GDAL Feature Layer.

8. MapSuite TileCache/Tile Matrix, based on current design, the TileView, TileCache, Tile, Matrix are thread safe. It will improve the performance greatly.

* Matrix: Create/Calculate the matrix system for TileLayer and TileOverlay.
* Tile: The tiles for the cached items, the tile contains the tile data and tile location (z,x,y)
* TileCache: Tile Cache for ThinkGeo, it work with one tile.
* TileView: TileOverlay each tile view, it only draw the layers or render the drawing result in UI.

9. Refine our MapSuite properties, make sure set one property wonâ€™t change other properties, like Map.Unit will update the map extent, .etc.

10. Support Rotation for WPF.

11. Support StyleJson.
